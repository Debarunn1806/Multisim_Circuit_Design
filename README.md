   - Simulation of amplitude modulation for signal transmission and its corresponding demodulation process.  

2. **Bandpass Filter**  
   - Design and simulation of a bandpass filter for frequency selection in communication systems.  

3. **Multiplexer (MUX) and Demultiplexer (DEMUX)**  
   - Implementation of MUX and DEMUX circuits for data routing and signal distribution.  

4. **Pulse Modulation and Demodulation**  
   - Simulation of pulse modulation techniques and their demodulation processes.  

5. **Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) and Demodulation**  
   - Design of a PPM system for efficient signal representation and its decoding.  

6. **White Noise Generation**  
   - Circuit for generating white noise, used for testing and analyzing system behavior under random noise conditions.  

## Simulation Environment  
- All circuits were designed and simulated in the **Multisim** software.
